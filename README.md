# A Tetris game in Assembly

The main goal of this project was to implement a tetris game assembly language and run it in a NIOS2 processor (GECKO4EDUCATION) using Quartus.

## Getting Started

This section describes the necessary steps to run the program on the Gecko4EPFL board :
• Please use the NiosII CPU provided in the Quartus project quartus/GECKO.qpf .
• Compile the Quartus project.
• Program the FPGA.

### Prerequisites

To adjust, test and run the project you will need :

• nios2sim Simulator (Java 10)
• Gecko4Education-EPFL 
• multicycle Nios II processor
• Quartus 

## Built With

* [Quartus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html) - Software to run the project 
* [NiosII](http://stpe.github.io/jniosemu/) - NiosII simulator (You can use the niosII.jar directly)
